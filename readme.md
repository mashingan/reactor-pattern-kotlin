# Reactor Pattern
This is reactor pattern implemented using Kotlin which translated from [this article](http://jeewanthad.blogspot.com/2013/02/reactor-pattern-explained-part-1.html).  
It demonstrates how easily to work with Kotlin and its inter-op with Java libraries.  
The example using a server which serves concurrent clients connection using ``channel`` and ``Selector`` to make sure all connections can be done asynchronously.
